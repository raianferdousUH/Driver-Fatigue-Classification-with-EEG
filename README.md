# Driver-Fatigue-Classification-with-EEG
 The project aimed at classifying driver fatigue during driving to prevent street accidents. Time series EEG data was utilized for the analysis, and the temporal features of the were extracted. Through feature engineering, the most effective features were chosen to train classifiers based on machine learning and deep learning.
